# [ STILL WIP ]
> Please note that the information contained in this repository is based on the **2025 Turkish Curriculum at the middle school level**. Even though this is mainly for personal use, if you do wish to make use of it, remember that it **might not be fully up to date in the next few years**. Moreover, the information will be **severely outdated by the year of 2029** as the curriculum was revised completely very recently. This does not mean the repository will be taken down or archived, however, in hopes of [digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation).

## Why did I make this?
- to be unbound to the world of physical books and handwritten notes
- to visualize the connection between two separate notes more clearly
- to practice [digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) and [cumulative learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_learning)
- to flex with my immaculate knowledge and hard work

## Can I use this?
I mean yeah I honestly don't mind at all go crazy with it. Just make sure to take the warning at the very top at face value. Also keep in mind that since this is meant for my personal use, i will not put the **.obsidian** folder in **.gitignore** to make it easier for me to set it up quickly. You can still customize the vault to your own preferences.
