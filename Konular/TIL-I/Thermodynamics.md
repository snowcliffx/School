- 1 Cal = 1 kcal = 1000 cal
- 1 cal = 4.184 Joules
- 1 L * atm = 101.3 Joules
- latent heat: L = energy required to change the state of a substance
- specific heat capacity: c = öz ısı = özgül ısı
- heat capacity: C = ısı sığası
- molar heat capacity: cₘ = C/n
- Q = mcΔT

- open system: energy (heat) and matter can be exchanged
- closed systen: energy can be exchanged but matter cant
- isolated system: energy and matter cant be exchanged

___
# FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
- ΔU = Q - W
- Change in internal energy is equal to change in heat energy minus the work done by the system.
## Isobaric: Constant Pressure
- W = PΔV = nRΔT (work done by gas if the pressure is constant). 
- 1 Pascal * 1m³ = 1J (look above)
- R = 8.1345J/(mol * K)
- Q = nCₚΔT (because n * Cₚ = C and CΔT = mcΔT)
- ΔU = nCᵥΔT
- Cₚ: molar heat capacity at constant pressure = Cᵥ + R
- Cᵥ: 3/2R for monatomic, 5/2R for diatomic, 7/2R for triatomic gases and so on.

## Isochoric: Constant Volume
- The word "rigid" means not flexible as in the shape and volume cant change.
- Since ΔV = 0 and W = PΔV, W is always 0 therefore ΔU = Q.
- P1/T1 = P2/T2 because of PV=nRT and V is constant.
- ΔU = nCᵥΔT

## Isothermal: Constant Temperature
- ΔU = nCᵥΔT, but ΔT therefore ΔU = 0
- 0 = Q - W, so W = Q
- W = nRT * ln(Vf/Vₒ) or nRT * ln(Pₒ/Pf)

## Adiabatic: No Transferred Heat
- Q = 0 therefore ΔU = -W
- ΔU = nCᵥΔT
- W = (-Cᵥ/R) * (PfVf - PₒVₒ)

___

# SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
- Heat transfers from hot temp to cold temp.
- ΔS > 0 (natural)
- ΔS = 0 (ideal)

___

# ENGINES AND CYCLES
- stuff and stuff

## Heat Engines
- Qₕ = Energy absorbed by the hot reservoir.
- Qc = Energy discarded into the cold reservoir.
- W = |Qₕ| - |Qc| or Qₕ + Qc (because Qc already has a minus before it)
- Efficiency = (W/Qₕ) x 100
- Power = W/t (time here is technically the amount of cycles done in 1 second)

## Carnot Cycle
- Efficiency of a carnot engine: e(carnot) = 1 - (Tc/Tₕ) in Kelvin
- Tc is the cold (exhaust) temperature whereas Tₕ is the hot temperature.
- Tc/Tₕ = |Qₕ| / |Qc|
- If the cold temp decreases or hot temp increases then efficiency also increases.
